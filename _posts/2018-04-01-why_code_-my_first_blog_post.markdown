I remember the first computer I ever saw, it was an Apple IIe. My dad had brought it home from work and even though I was only 3 I still knew that it was an incredible machine.  As I grew up I still remember each computer that was brought home as well as the first time we went online. As the screech of the dial-up started I knew my life and the lives of everyone around me were about to change forever. Being part of the first generation to grow up with computers, I knew they would be an integral part of my daily life. But, if someone ever asked  me if I was interested in computer science I would have shrugged and said it wasn't for me.

Fast forward to my 30's and through a series of events, I have started to understand how amazing writing code is. I love puzzles and solving problems. My wife and I are Escape Room fanatics and have played many games nationwide. Writing code gives me the thrill of puzzle solving every time I sit down to write. I'm fascinated by what a few lines and can and once again amazed by the power of computers. I've been enrolled in Flatiron's Online Boot Camp for about 3 weeks( this blog post is late, as I missed this deadline memo), but every day I am thrilled to open up the curriculum. I wake up every day with the excitement of what I will learn and where this new found passion will lead me. I look forward to developing my skills and the opportunity of a rewarding and fulfilling new career in software/web development.
